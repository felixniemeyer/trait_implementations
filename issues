validation of friend requests...

Concept of "friendship" = see information the other one does not? 
=> Hard to realize on Holochain, where everything is transparent?

How about: a continous level for followships
-> 0 = no followship
-> towards infinity = i love you so much

-> interesting metric: ratio between both directions of followship between two people

-> or tag links between agents with either 'follow' or 'friend'. 
	- Challenge: is it possible to create links between agents directly? 
		- if not, use an anchor


//

- will the holochain traits (e.g. social-graph) reside in their own Cargo package? 
- functions listed in social-graph and in hc_public trait? 
- anchors / pagination


VALIDATION 
- Get the link issuing agent hash like this:         Create{ validation_data, .. } => if validation_data.package.chain_header.provenances[0] == AGENT_WHO_IS_ALLOWED_TO_WRITE { ... }
