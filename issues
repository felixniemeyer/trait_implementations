Brainstorm: next steps: 
	- automated test
	- use trait from cargo (evtl. consistency rename followings) 
	- indroduce profiles to replace current use of agents
		- discuss with josh
		- pro
			- following links etc. directly between profiles
			- one agent can handle multiple profiles (e.g. for businesses) under the same agent key
	- validation of entries and links
		- anchors
			- provanance_agent == entry.agent_address
		- followship / friendship 
			- provenance_agent == entry.agent_address
		- 

# someday

Concept of "friendship" = see information the other one does not? 
	=> Hard to realize on Holochain, where everything is transparent?
		=> solution: spawn private dnas, maybe membranes

How about: a continous level for followships
	-> 0 = no followship
	-> towards infinity = i love you so much
		-> interesting metric: ratio between both directions of followship between two people

Or tag links between agents with either 'follow' or 'friend'. 
	- Challenge: is it possible to create links between agents directly? 
		- if not, use an anchor

- will the holochain traits (e.g. social-graph) reside in their own Cargo package? 
- functions listed in social-graph and in hc_public trait? 
- anchors / pagination


VALIDATION 
- Get the link issuing agent hash like this:         Create{ validation_data, .. } => if validation_data.package.chain_header.provenances[0] == AGENT_WHO_IS_ALLOWED_TO_WRITE { ... }
